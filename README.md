# Final Capstone Project


The structure of this project was to simulate the true life cycle of developing software, including the written documentation associated with it. An idea similar to that of Amazon's e-commerce platform was chosen for this project by my teammates and I.

Initially, we created a set of program requirements. From these requirements, we created a database to store all the information we would need to be able to create a web commerce platform. Database tables included Products, Orders, Authentication, and Order Details. The design document template contains a graph detailing each table and their members.

Required System Functions
-Signup/Login (Authentication with hashed password security)
-Cart System
-Third party payment system integration
-API for CRUD actions on product, order, auth and order detail data
-Dynamically created product sections, as well as each individual page
