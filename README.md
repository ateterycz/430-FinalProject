# Final Capstone Project


The structure of this project was to simulate the true life cycle of developing software, including the written documentation associated with it. An idea similar to that of Amazon's e-commerce platform was chosen for this project by my teammates and I.
We utilized an Agile method of creating the software, allowing for changes to be made to the software requirements as the program was developed. Our team also employed the use of Scrum, a schedule of weekly meetings and goals to be met.

Initially, we created a set of program requirements. From these requirements, we created a database to store all the information we would need to be able to create a web commerce platform. Database tables included Products, Orders, Authentication, and Order Details. The design document template contains a graph detailing each table and their members.


Required System Functions

-Signup/Login (Authentication with hashed password security)

-Cart System

-Third party payment system integration

-API for CRUD actions on product, order, auth and order detail data

-Dynamically created product sections, as well as each individual page


package.json includes the dependencies necessary to run the web application locally.

Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.
npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.
npm run eject

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
